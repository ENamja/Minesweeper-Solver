Minesweeper Solving Algorithm

The following project is an algorithm made as a class project for an AI class. The code we wrote can be seen in the MyAI.py file. All other files were given as a template to test our algorithm. The algorithm implements basic fundamentals of AI such as heuristic search, and further implements Harvard sentence-reduction logic to make the algorithm both accurate and efficient. The algorithm was able to accurately solve worlds of varying sizes (5x5, 8x8, 16x16, 16x30) in a small amount of time, going through around 1100 worlds in under 5 minutes.
