Minesweeper Solving Algorithm

The following project is an algorithm made as a class project for an AI class. The code we wrote can be seen in the MyAI.py file. All other files were given as a template to test our algorithm. The algorithm implements basic fundamentals of AI such as heuristic search, and further implements Harvard sentence-reduction logic to make the algorithm both accurate and efficient. There are three different types of worlds that the algorithm was tested with: easy, medium, and expert worlds.
